          <p class="textPadding">
            The Pigeon Coop is an assortment of cabins located along the shores
            of beautiful lake Tobin, Canada. We specialize in catering to the
            hunting and fishing demographic of tourists visiting Canada to enjoy
            the great outdoors. Visitors to the Pigeon Coop cabins will find a
            variety of cabins that can be used as a base of operations for
            groups of hunters or fishermen, or even as a relaxing getaway for
            the outdoors-loving family. Our cabins vary in size and price, with
            a total available selection of 6 cabins, each housing between 4 and
            12 people. In addition to the fair weather crowd, we also remain
            open throughout the winter months to allow for the ultimate
            ice-fishing getaway. For convenience, all payments are conducted
            online, and refunds are not allowed when cancelling a reservation
            less than 3-months away.

            When you visit a Pigeon Coop cabin, you are experiencing the best
            the great Canadian outdoors has to offer. Hunting, fishing,
            kayaking, skiing, hiking, biking, rafting, and so much more are all
            available and within reasonable distances. In addition, we run a local diner/game-hall thats situated within 5 miles of all our cabins.
            This main lodge is open to all, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The main lodge (pictured below) also has an assortment of pool tables, board games, and a dedicated bar. 
            When bringing a boat, our customers can use the landing at the main lodge, or you can rent paddle-boats, canoes, kayaks, and various water-toys. We think you'll love the
            cozy feel of our cabins and the great adventures possible starting
            right at the doorstep, we encourage you to check out the different
            cabins available for rental, as well as the activities and
            attractions listed on the attractions page.

          What People are Saying About Us
        </h2>
        <span class="quotes" id="quote1"
          >These cabins are better than sliced bread, I can't believe I've never
          taken a trip to this place before. I would probably sell my left
          kidney to buy one of them. Everyone in my medium sized family loved
          the trip and all the outdoors fun available to just about anyone up
          there. Check out the Calgary Stampede if you book a trip, you wont be
          dissapointed! We will be coming back next summer for sure. Despite the
          name, there were no pigeons sharing the cabins with us either, which
          was a bonus. Highly recommend these cabins to anyone looking for a
          great time<br />

          >Wow, I would sell both my kidneys to purchase one of these cabins,
          what an amazing place. I went on a trip with my brother, Billy Bob,
          and we just had the time of our life. The fish we caught were at least
          as big as a small shopping cart, yes that big. The weather was
          beautiful, and I couldn't have asked for much more from the cabin
          itself either. I'll be sure to get my other brother, Joe Bob, up here
          with us next time. Could not recommend this place more, look into
          Banff Park if you want to really see the sights up here, though you
          won't be dissapointed by what you see out your window .<br />- Mary

        <span class="quotes" id="quote3"
          >I already sold both my kidneys and my left pinkie to get a cabin in
          the same area as this place, what a beautiful area. My family of 12
          took a two week trip to the cabins, and I loved every minute of it.
          They were not lying about all the things you could do up in those
          parts. We spent part of our trip on a short excursion to Whistler and
          had the time of our lives. If you are looking for a place to escape
          the emails and phone calls, look no further than the pigeon coop
          cabins, you 10000% will never find someplace better. Also this review
          is totally not fake, please book a trip now.<br />- Tony Stark</span

            The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo, exhibition, and festival
            held every July in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The ten-day event,
            which bills itself as "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth", attracts
            over one million visitors per year and features one of the world's
            largest rodeos, a parade, midway, stage shows, concerts,
            agricultural competitions, chuckwagon racing, and First Nations
            exhibitions. In 2008, the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the
            ProRodeo Hall of Fame.
          </p>
          <p class="textPadding">
            The event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District
            Agricultural Society held its first fair. In 1912, American promoter
            Guy Weadick organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the
            Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory
            Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's
            festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the
            Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the Calgary Exhibition and
            Stampede.

          <p class="textPadding">
            Calgary's national and international identity is tied to the event.
            It is known as the "Stampede City", carries the informal nickname of
            "Cowtown", and the local Canadian Football League team is called the
            Stampeders. The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede:
            office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes,
            residents don western wear, and events held across the city include
            hundreds of pancake breakfasts and barbecues.

            Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest
            national park and was established in 1885. Located in the Rocky
            Mountains, 110–180 kilometres (68–112 mi) west of Calgary and 145
            kilometres (90 mi) from Calgary International Airport in the
            province of Alberta, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres
            (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice
            fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The
            Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper
            National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National
            Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is
            located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The
            main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow
            River valley.
          </p>
          <p class="textPadding">
            Banff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination
            and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with
            more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff
            contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy. A park
            pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are
            common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the
            start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if
            travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately
            5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada
            Highway without stopping.

            Whistler (Squamish language: Sḵwiḵw) is a resort municipality in the
            southern Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in the province of
            British Columbia, Canada, approximately 125 km (78 mi) north of
            Vancouver and 36 km (22 mi) south of the town of Pemberton.
            Incorporated as the Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW), it has a
            permanent population of approximately 11,854, plus a larger but
            rotating population of seasonal workers, typically younger people
            from beyond British Columbia, notably from United Kingdom, Australia
            and Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="textPadding">
            Over two million people visit Whistler annually, primarily for
            alpine skiing and snowboarding and, in summer, mountain biking at
            Whistler Blackcomb. Its pedestrian village has won numerous design
            awards and Whistler has been voted among the top destinations in
            North America by major ski magazines since the mid-1990s. During the
            2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler hosted most of the alpine, Nordic,
            luge, skeleton, and bobsled events.
